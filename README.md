# CARMA Time Library

The CARMA Time Library is a focused library providing classes and utilities which enable a consuming project to synchronize mock time with the CARMA simulation framework.

# Architecture

The CarmaClock class contains an internal representation for time which serves as a replacement for the epoch tracked by the system clock, or any other related time-keeping machinery.

This internal time value is stored as a TODO value representing TODO since TODO.

The framework provides the following capabilities:
1. Initialization and update functions which set the internal time representation mode and value.
2. Current time available for query.
3. Time representation available in real-time and simulation mode.
4. The framework falls back to system time if not running in simulation mode.
5. Utility functions.

# Building the Library
## Configuring Build Environment

The project build environment is supplied as a single-image [Docker Dev Environment](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dev-environments/), with Visual Studio Code editor configurations to enable streamlined setup.

To load the project in VSCode:

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-time-lib.git
cd carma-time-lib/
```

2. Open the VSCode editor.
3. Open the cloned project folder.
4. Accept the **Reopen in Container** prompt for **"Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container (learn more)."**

![Dev Container Rebuild Notification](doc/images/DevContainerRebuildNotification.png)

7. If that prompt did not appear, open the **View > Command Palette** and type to locate **"Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"**.
6. The editor should refresh and display the updated activity in the command line.

If the container startup was successful, the development environment is up and running and contains the library dependencies and compilation environment. It is possible to proceed with the build.

## Building

1. In VSCode, open **Build the Terminal > Run Build Task...**.

![Library Build Log](doc/images/LibraryBuildLog.png)

2. If the build is successful, tests are automatically executed and a Debian package is generated.
3. TODO more details (output product locations, reference information for generalized docker dev solution including container configured locations etc.).

## Additional IDE Configuration

Some additional configurations are provided out-of-the-box to streamline the developer's setup process. These are included for Visual Studio Code:
